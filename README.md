# Angular Atlas

A little weekend project to jolt my knowlege of Angular JS of a few things.

Demo: http://ng-atlas.herokuapp.com/

## What is it made of?

The app uses the following:

- v1.4.7 of [Angular JS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
- [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) is being used for routing. 
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for the interface.
- [Angular Google Maps](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/) for the map

## What does it contain?

There are a few controllers, some nested views, a service, an HTTP Interceptor and a directive for the loader.

## How to Setup?

Simply clone the repository and access the `index.html` in the route directory through your browser. 


## What is missing?

The dependencies should have been installed through bower, I should have wrote some gulp tasks for minifying and combining those numerous Javascript files. But I was Okay with it as long as it served the purpose and it did.

What else is missing, what other problems does it have? I would love to hear from you. Feel free to open any issues or reach me directly at kamranahmed.se@gmail.com
